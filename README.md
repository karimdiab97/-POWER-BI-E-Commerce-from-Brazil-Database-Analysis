# -POWER-BI-E-Commerce-from-Brazil-Database-Analysis

# Introduction
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization project about a Brazilian e-commerce platform known as Olist, which connects merchants to customers interested in purchase of their products and/or services. The dataset was made available to the public to enable Data Analysts gain better understanding of the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and optimization. This project was done during a data analysis challenge hosted online by @DataChallengeSpace where each person carries out the project with any tool of choice. I chose to carry out the project using Power BI to hone my DAX & Data modelling skills among others, while providing insights that identifies opportunities for growth and optimization for the Olist e-commerce platform.

About the Data
The raw data was gotten from Kaggle. It contains 9 tables which are Olist_customers, Olist_geolocation, Olist_order_items, Olist_order_payments, Olist_order_reviews, Olist_orders, Olist_products, Olist_sellers, Product_category_name. These tables contain a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, customer reviews, sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer behaviour and demographics. You can check out the data dictionary for description of the tables' contents.
